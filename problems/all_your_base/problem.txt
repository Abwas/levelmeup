To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple {italic}hello world{/italic}.

Write a Node program that accepts two command line arguments, {bold}X{/bold} and
{bold}Y{/bold} and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR {bold}{italic}X{/italic}{/bold} ARE BELONG TO {bold}{italic}Y{/italic}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {appname} run program.js

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {appname} verify program.js

And your submission will be verified for correctness. Once you have
a correct solution, run `{appname}` again and select the next problem!
