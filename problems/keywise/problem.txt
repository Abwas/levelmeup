Sometimes you might want keys to appear in a specific order but don't want to
bother with picking delimiters and a key format that will sort well.
The {bold}bytewise{/bold} module can help with this.

You will be given the path to a json file on `process.argv[3]`

The json file is an array with rows of the form

    {"type":"user","name":"maxogden"}

for users and

    {"type":"repo","name":"mux-demux","user":"dominictarr"}

for repositories.

You should open the database path given by `process.argV[2]` and write data to
the database using `"!"` as a delimiter such that the verify script will be able
to read the repos for each user by doing:

    db.createReadStream({ start: 'rvagg!', end: 'rvagg~' })



When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
