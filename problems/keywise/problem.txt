Sometimes you might want keys to appear in a specific order but don't want to
bother with picking delimiters and a key format that will sort well.
The {bold}bytewise{/bold} module can help with this.

For example, suppose we have a list of npm users and projects. For each user
page, we'll want to show the list of projects written by that user.

You could pick a delimiter but this is a bit messy when there are a lot of
fields and is tricky to get right if you allow key names to come from external
user input.

But what if we also want to list `npm star` data for each project?




  ALL YOUR {bold}{italic}X{/italic}{/bold} ARE BELONG TO {bold}{italic}Y{/italic}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
