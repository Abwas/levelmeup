Write a program that opens a LevelDB data-store using `{bold}level{/bold}`.

The full path to the data-store will be provided to your program as
the first command-line argument.

The second command-line argument contains a complete JSON-encoded
object. Parse this object and {bold}put{/bold} each key/value pair in the
object into your data-store.

Your solution will be verified by reading the data-store and checking
against the object provided to you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

The `put()` method in LevelUP is very simple, you simply need to
supply the key and value. An optional callback may be passed where
you need to know when the data has been committed to the store or to
properly catch any errors (otherwise errors will be thrown):

  var db = level('/path/to/db/')
  db.put('foo', 'bar', function (err) {
    if (err)
      return console.error('Error in put():', err)
    console.log('put foo = bar')
  })

You may also call `db.close()` after all your callbacks have returned,
however this is optional as the data-store will be automatically
closed when your program exits and an open LevelDB store will not keep
your program running indefinitely.
